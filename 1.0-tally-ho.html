<h2>Tally Ho!</h2>


To tally a box means to systematically count the items (or points) inside.
<br/>
<br/>
<div>
    <x3d showStat="false" width="350" height="250">
        <scene>
            <transform translation="-0.5 -0.5 0" scale="1 1 1">
                <inline url="x3d/grid-7x5x3.x3d"/>
            </transform>
        </scene>
    </x3d>
</div>


The process seems obvious:
<ol type="I">
    <li>assign an initial tally value of 0</li>
    <li>
        unpack each point (systematically)
        <ol type="i">
            <li>assign the current tally value to the current point</li>
            <li>increase the tally by 1</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>collect the final tally</li>
    <li>assert that the final tally is equal to the volume of the box</li>
</ol>

At the end of the process,
each point will have been assigned a unique tally value,
from 0 up to one less than the volume of the box
- each point is identified by a unique index value in the range.
