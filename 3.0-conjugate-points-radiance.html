<h3>Conjugate Points and Radiance</h3>

Two points are conjugate when they are symmetrically opposite each other, with respect to the centre of the box.
<br/>
<br/>
Consider an object that travels back and forth between a point and its conjugate.
<ul>
    <li><i>per completed cycle</i>, the object has energy proportional to the square of the euclidean distance travelled</li>
    <li>the square of the euclidean distance from a point to its conjugate is the radiance of the point</li>
    <li>the sum of the radiance of every point in the box is the box radiance</li>
    <li>the radiance is a maximal value</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
The radiance can be represented in a euclidean diagram,
or in a radiance diagram where all the points are stretched out in a single line
in index order.

The euclidean radiance is a function of the bases of the box
whereas the index radiance is a function of the volume only.
<br/>
<br/>

The radiance can be considered as an operator that swaps each point with its conjugate.
<br/>
<br/>
Applying the radiance operator twice returns each point to its starting place - equivalent to the identity operator.
