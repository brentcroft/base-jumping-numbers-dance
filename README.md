# Thinking inside the Box: Finding Groups.

A box is specified by a sequence of non-zero base numbers, say: `[ b_0, b_1, ..., b_(n-1) ]`.
> the box rank is the number of bases.

> the box volume is the product of the bases.

A box specifies a set of points, with order equal to the box volume, say: `[ x_0, x_1, ..., x_(n-1) ]`.
> for each place **i**: `0 <= x_i < b_i`.


#### Point Indexes:
The points in the box can be indexed so that:
  1. Every point has a unique index value that is between zero and the box volume minus one.
  2. The origin point [0,0, ..., 0] has the minimum index (i.e. 0).
  3. The point opposite to the origin, via the centre of the box, has the maximum index value (i.e. the box volume minus one).

A box of rank **n** has **n!** permutations of its bases,
each providing a linear place-value function that indexes the points as required.
Note that repetitions of the bases will duplicate permutations.

Each pair of indexes, laid side-by-side, provides a permutation of the points: a **box action**.
Note that a pair of identical indexes will implement the identity permutation.

A box has **n!n(n-1)** actions (excluding identical pairs) 
and they form a group with a structure entirely defined by the rank of the box.
  1. each action appears with its inverse
  2. each action has echoes

A box group contains subgroups that implement all possible factorings of the box volume,
thereby decomposing the box into constituent sub-boxes of lesser rank.

## Example: Box 3 x 5 x 7
The following table shows the labelled set of box actions, with inverses, echoes and identities removed.

NB: A radiance index and its square are reinstated to provide an identity.

Each row can be visualised in 3 dimensions, 
showing the orbit perimeters, the orbit centres, 
and the fixed points, for example z_0

Each row can be visualised in 2 dimensions,
indicating the index radiance, for example z_0:
